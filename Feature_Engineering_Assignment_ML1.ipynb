        "Answer: A parameter is a variable in a model that the algorithm learns from the data. Examples include coefficients in linear regression or weights in neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is correlation?\n",
        "Answer: Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.\n",
        "# What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "Answer: Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. Example: Hours spent watching TV and exam score may have negative correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "Answer: Machine Learning is a field of AI that allows systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Main components: Data, Features, Model, Algorithm, and Evaluation metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "Answer: Loss value measures how well the model predictions match the actual data. Lower loss indicates better model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "Answer: Continuous variables can take any numerical value (e.g., height, weight). Categorical variables represent discrete categories (e.g., gender, color).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "Answer: Categorical variables can be handled using techniques like One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, and Ordinal Encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "Answer: Training dataset is used to fit the model, while testing dataset is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "Answer: sklearn.preprocessing is a module in scikit-learn that provides functions for scaling, normalizing, encoding, and transforming features.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is a Test set?\n",
        "Answer: A test set is a subset of the dataset used to evaluate the performance of a trained machine learning model.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python? How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        "Answer: Use train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection. Example:\n",
        "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
        "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
        "Approach: 1. Understand the problem, 2. Collect data, 3. Preprocess data, 4. Split data, 5. Train model, 6. Evaluate, 7. Tune and deploy.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "Answer: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps understand data distribution, relationships, outliers, and missing values to guide preprocessing and model selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. What is correlation?\n",
        "Answer: Correlation quantifies the degree to which two variables are related linearly, with values ranging from -1 to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "Answer: Negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other decreases (inverse relationship).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "Answer: Using pandas: df.corr() or numpy: np.corrcoef(X, Y)\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "Answer: Causation means one variable directly affects another. Correlation only indicates relationship, not cause. Example: Ice cream sales and drowning incidents may be correlated (summer season) but ice cream does not cause drowning.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
        "Answer: Optimizers update model parameters to minimize loss. Common types:\n",
